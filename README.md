### Problem Statement

I am a consumer looking for a place to save my images. I want to be able to have the ability to
upload and delete images. Extra functionality that will help me utilize my saved images is welcomed!

### ImageNest Context

ImageNest is an image repository that lets you have control over your images. ImageNest currently
allows you to:

- Upload images

        Uploading images is supported by the "uploadImage" API endpoint.


- Delete images

        Deleting images is supported by the "deleteImage" API endpoint.

**Technologies used**

- Java(Spring Boot)

        The main reason I used java is to show my structural and design skills that can be
        I can easily demostrate in Java.

- Thymeleaf

        I am familiar with front-end frameworks such as React as I have used both React and
        React Native before. However, I wanted to pick up something new that I did not use before.
        Thus, i decided to use Thymeleaf which is a server-side java template engine.

- SQL

        I have experience with NoSQL(Neo4j) and SQL(mySQL, PostgreSQL) technologies. Since I did not
        have any focus on scalability or speed for this small application I decided to use mySQL
        to demonstrate my relational database skills and to demonstrate my skills of using an ORM
        technology such as hibernate
